# Geeks Backend
**NOTE** : Do not take the approaches used in this code as a refrence as I'm not using mongoose neither mongoDB in the best way possible ( Not using refrences for example ) . 
This code serves it's purpose which is developping an API , yet it is not the best way to do it neither close to be.
